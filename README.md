# **Twitter Spammer Classification**

## Overview

This project classifies Twitter users as spammers or non-spammers using a deep learning model trained on the [twitter_spammer dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinaykumar52/twitter-spammer-classification).

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following packages installed:

- `sklearn`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `tensorflow`
- `matplotlib`
- `keras`
- `requests`
- `Flask`

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deployment Structure

The project has the following components:

1. **`model.py`**: This script contains the code for the machine learning model used to classify Twitter users as spammers or non-spammers based on the input data.

2. **`app.py`**: This script contains the Flask APIs that receive input data (Twitter usernames) from the web interface or API calls, utilize the model to predict whether the provided Twitter username is a spammer, and return the prediction.

3. **`templates/`**: This directory contains the HTML templates for the web interface, allowing users to enter a Twitter username and view the spam detection results.

## Usage

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Create the model**: Ensure you are in the project home directory and run the following command to create the machine learning model:

    ```bash
    python model.py
    ```

    This command will create a serialized version of the model in the file `model.pkl`.

2. **Start the Flask API**: Run `app.py` using the following command to start the Flask server:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    By default, Flask will run on port 5000.

3. **Access the web interface**: Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

    On the web page, you will be prompted to enter a Twitter username.

    - **Username**: Enter the Twitter username you want to check.

4. **Check for spam**: Click the "Check Spam" button.

    If everything goes well, you will see the spam detection results displayed on the web page.

## Note

These instructions are for deploying the model on a local development environment.
